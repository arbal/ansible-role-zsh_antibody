Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

```yaml

antibody_version: "6.0.1"
antibody_bundles:
  # Bundles from the default repo (robbyrussell's oh-my-zsh) only need a name
  # https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins
  #
  # `name` is required (any valid file name will do so long as it's unique for the bundles)
  # `url` is git username/repo
  # `version` is git release and is required if `url` is defined
  # - name: ansible
  # - name: aws
  # - name: docker

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: iancleary.zsh_antibody
           users:
             - username: example
          antibody_bundles:
            - name: git
            # - name: pipenv
            - name: poetry
            - name: yarn
            - name: zsh
            # Syntax highlighting bundle.
            - name: zsh-syntax-highlighting
              repo:
                url: zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
                version: 0.7.1
            # Autosuggestions
            - name: zsh-autosuggestions # `name` is required (any valid file name will do so long as it's unique for the bundles)
              repo:
                url: zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
                version: v0.6.4
```

> Note: the role currently assumes all users want the same plugins, pull requests welcome if you'd prefer per user `antibody_bundles`

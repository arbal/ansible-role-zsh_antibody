Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

```yaml

  # `git.user` is git username
  # `git.repo` is git repo name
  # `git.version` is git release
  ## **** While `git` is option, if used, all three git attributes are required ****
  - name: gitfast

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: iancleary.zsh_antibody
      users:
        - username: test_usr1
        - username: test_usr2
        - username: test_usr3
          skip_zshrc: true
      antibody_bundles:
        - name: gitfast
        - name: poetry
        - name: yarn
        - name: zsh
        # Syntax highlighting bundle.
        - name: zsh-syntax-highlighting
          git:
            user: zsh-users
            repo: zsh-syntax-highlighting
            version: 0.7.1
```

> Note: the role currently assumes:

* all users want the same plugins, pull requests welcome if you'd prefer per user `antibody_bundles`
